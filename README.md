## How To INSTALL JFROG ARTIFACTORY ON UBUNTU 22.04

### What is Jfrog Artifactory

Artifactory is a universal DevOps solution for hosting, managing, and distributing binaries
and artifacts. Any type of software in binary form – such as application installers, container
images, libraries, configuration files, etc. – can be curated, secured, stored, and delivered 
using Artifactory.

The name “Artifactory” reflects the fact that it can host any type of “artifact” needed in your
software development “factory.” In software development, an artifact is any object produced 
during the software development and delivery process. Artifacts include the files used to install
and run applications, as well as any complementary information necessary to configure or manage software.

Artifactory serves as the central hub for your DevOps processes. All artifacts, dependencies, 
packages, etc. ultimately get put into and pulled from Artifactory.
